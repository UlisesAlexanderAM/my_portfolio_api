# job-hunting-helper (web)

Program to help in my job-hunting process. In the future I'll use fastapi, flask or django to implement it for the web. I'll create a new repo for the GUI version.

## Motivation

I started this project because I was unsatisfied with the implementation of this in a spreadsheet so I decided to build my program to use during my job-searching process.

Also, I started this so that I can showcase and improve my abilities as a software engineer. That's why I write down the user stories I came up with to describe the project.

## User interface mockups

Below are some mockups for the user interface, with the passed of time and as I progress in the development of the app I'll replace the mockups by screenshots of the working app.

This is how I imaginated the skill window without selecting any:

Now, with a skill selected:

And finally with all the skill selected:
